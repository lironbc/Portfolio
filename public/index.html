            I am a rising senior studying computer science at UC San Diego.
            I put a lot of pride in my code. That's why I write code that is
            accessible, performant, and simple to understand.

        <p>
            Hello! I'm Liron, a computer science student based in San Diego, CA.
        </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy creating fast and responsive software, whether that be websites,
            applications, or anything in between. I believe that apps should run smoothly
            regardless of device speed or network conditions. If you were able to
            load this page on a 2g network, then I did my job right!
        </p>
        <p>
            I love teaching and have spent hundreds of hours teaching
            code as a tutor at my university and as a
            instructor to kids at a coding summer camp.
        </p>
        <p>
            I currently work at Viasat as a software engineering intern where I work on a wide
            variety of interesting and meaningful projects on a daily basis.
        </p>
        <p>Here are some languages and technologies I'm proficient in:</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>JavaScript</td>
                <td>React</td>
                <td>Bootstrap</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Java</td>
                <td>HTML/CSS</td>
                <td>Firebase</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>C/C++</td>
                <td>JQuery</td>
                <td>Git/Github</td>
            </tr>
