            I am a rising senior studying computer science at UC San Diego.
            I believe that code is for everyone. That's why I write code that is
            accessible, performant, and simple to understand.

    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
        Hello! I'm Liron, a computer science student based in San Diego, CA
    </p>
    <p>
        I enjoy creating software that is fast and responsive. Whether that be websites,
        applications, or anything in between. I believe that my code should be accessible
        to anyone regardless of device speed or network conditions. If you were able to
        load this page on a 2g network, then I did my job right!
    </p>
    <p>
        I love to spread my knowledge about code to kids and adults alike and have
        spent hundreds of hours teaching code as a tutor at my university and as a
        instructor to kids at a coding summer camp.
    </p>
    <p>
        I currently work at Viasat as a software engineering intern where I work on a wide
        variety of interesting and meaningful projects on a daily basis.
    </p>
    <p>Here are some languages and technologies I'm proficient in:</p>
